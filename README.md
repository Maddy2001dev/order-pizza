This project utilizing redux toolkit for managing global UI state and react router for routing, i've used new react router +v6.4 feature for declaring routes and for reading and writing data (CRUD operations) ustilized loaders and actions, its kinda a good alternative for tanstack query (react query) library. this new feature of react router provides a lot for us like error handling and showing a fallback during loading phases, i've used built-in react-router-dom "Form component" for user's input considerations.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
